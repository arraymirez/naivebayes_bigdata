# Meaning
A naive Bayesian classifier is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem and some simplifying hypotheses.

The naive or simple Bayesian classifier (NBC) is based on the assumption that all the attributes are independent given the class variable. 

The naive Bayes formulation drastically reduces the complexity of the Bayesian classifier, as in this case we only require the prior probability (one dimensional vector) of the class, and the n conditional probabilities of each attribute given the class (two dimensional matrices). The space requirement is reduced from exponential to linear in the number of attributes. 



# Bayes Theorem
In probability theory, it is a proposition raised by the English mathematician Thomas Bayes and published posthumously in 1763, which expresses the conditional probability of:

Â  "A random event A given B in terms of the conditional probability distribution of event B given A and the marginal probability distribution of only A"
